    <p class="post-description">I carried out teachings during the period of my thesis and during my service of ATER. During my thesis, I had the opportunity to teach from 2018 to 2020 at the Faculty of Sciences and Engineering Sciences of South Brittany (SSI), at the IUT of Vannes - Université Bretagne Sud and at the Military school Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan, which makes a total of 90h's of teaching. During my ATER service, I teach at the UFR ISTIC of the University of Rennes 1, which makes a total of 192h's teaching.</p>
